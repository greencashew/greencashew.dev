Schema - a template that identifies a subset of strings with similarities at certain string position. * the wildcard means 0 or 1 (Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter) S1 = (*01*00110) - this schema is represented by 4 strings (only changes filled): V1 = (0 0 ) V2 = (0 1 ) V3 = (1 0 ) V4 = (1 1 ) Schema Order o(S) is defined as the number of fixed positions in the template: S1 = (*1***1**0) o(S1) = 3 S2 = (*1**01*111) o(S2) = 6 Schema Length δ(S) is the distance between first and last fixed position.</description></item></channel></rss>
